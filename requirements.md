I want to know when payday is

So that I know when I can buy all the things that I want to buy.

A/C:

It should return the 27th of the month.
If the 27th is a Saturday or Sunday it should return the previous day before the 27th which is not a Saturday or Sunday.
You can ignore bank holidays for the sake of this exercise.
In December, payday is on the 14th. Following all the same rules as above.
It must return the next payday, i.e. never return a date in the past.
If today is payday, the result should indicate that the returned date is today.
